To capture particular field of url in nginx use regex and parenthesis.
Each parenthesis value will be passed to $1 , $2 ... and so on.

location ~ ^/(users)/v2/(.+)$ {
    proxy_pass http://app.domain.com/api/$1/v2/$2;
}

here users is matched in regex and value of (.+1) is saved as $1

server fault - A generic rule for regex captures in nginx is that any regular expression inside parentheses is captured in a variable. First parentheses content is captured into $1 and so on.
